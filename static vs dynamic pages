static vs dynamic pages
static served from public directory

idiom:
--need a route
 Failure/Error: visit '/static_pages/about'
     ActionController::RoutingError:
       No route matches [GET] "/static_pages/about"

--need an action (+ controller)
Failure/Error: visit '/static_pages/about'
     AbstractController::ActionNotFound:
       The action 'about' could not be found for StaticPagesController

--need a view
Failure/Error: visit '/static_pages/about'
     ActionView::MissingTemplate:
       Missing template static_pages/about, application/about with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html], :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :coffee]}. Searched in:
         * "/home/radar/workspace/cs380/sample_app/app/views"
-- should have content
 Failure/Error: page.should have_content('About')
       expected there to be content "About" in "SampleApp\n\n\n\n"
